# Refactor Practice
It's difficult to find non-trivial refactoring challenges online. The Guilded Rose challenge is one of the better ones I found and this is my solution. I tried to make my commits small and explain my thought process.

My main goal was to improve the readabilty of the code and to make the new functionality easy to add. I love feedback so feel free to reachout!

## Orginal Instructions - Gilded Rose Refactoring Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to improve the design of the GuildedRose.php file and then to add the additional functionality described in the requirements.txt file.
